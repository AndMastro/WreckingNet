We didn't add any ArrayMic records.

We don't know whether some classes are the same (In some cases we don't have the complete name of the veichle), we will consider them as different classes.

These samples are already processed with SVM, so we ignore them:
	Loader JD333E Compact, 
	Bobcat 331 Excavator,

Audios containing more veichles are discared - we can use them for testes:
	Komatsu PC 45 MR Excavator and JCB 225T Bulldozer 1 and 2,
	Komatsu PC 45 MR and PC200 Excavators,
	
These contains also the audio of the veichles separated (we took only the separated):
	Komatsu PC200 Excavator and GEHL Telhandler,
	CAT C5K Bulldozer and CAT 305E Excavator,
	CAT Bulldozer and CAT CS44 Compactor,
	Bomag Compactor and JD 544K Loader,
	Bobcat Loader and Bobcat Excavator,
